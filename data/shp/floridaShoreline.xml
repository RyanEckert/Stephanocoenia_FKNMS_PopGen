            <abstract>This GIS data set represents the shoreline for Florida.</abstract>
            <purpose>Florida's shoreline was heads-up digitized using ARC Map software and color aerial photography downloaded from Labins.org as DOQQs (which were taken/captured in the beginning and throughout the 2004 year depending on the Water Management District and have approximately 1:12,000 scale accuracy). Included is all of Florida's coast, inner-coastal (Bays, Harbors, etc.), coastal rivers (Approximately 10 miles on average or to the end of the river traced), coastal canals, coastal lakes connected to the ocean and all of Lake Okeechobee and the St. Johns River.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Please consider this shoreline to be a draft product. Use at your own risk. FWRI staff heads-up digitized the shoreline using 2004 DOQQs. In some cases 2004 were not available and 1999 or 1994 source imagery was used. FWRI and other agencies have conducted a QC of this shoreline, but we are still finding errors with it in specific locations, including missing islands, and some areas that have less detailed linework. Please assist us with the QC process by reporting any errors you find to GISLibrarian@MyFWC.com. Please include information that describes the problem and a description or screen shot to assist us in locating the area of concern. Please also include contact information in case we need additional clarification from you.We ask that you do not redistribute this file; instead refer users to FWRI for the most recent update. We will incorporate corrections as they are reported.Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information.</supplinf>

            <procstep>
                <procdesc>Florida's shoreline was heads-up digitized using ARC Map software and color aerial photography downloaded from Labins.org. (DOQQs were captured throughout 2004, depending on the water management district and have approximately 1:12,000 scale accuracy). The extent to which rivers were digitized upstream was similar to FWRI's 1:40,000 scale shoreline data set, or if vegetation in the imagery prevented digitizing the full extent of the river, it was digitized as far as it was visible.Some existing shoreline data were used as a base in some areas, including a 1999 shoreline provided by Northwest Florida Water Management District, a 1999 Indian River Lagoon shoreline provided by the St. Johns River Water Management District, the FWRI 1:40,000 scale shoreline, and a shoreline used for the 1992 South Florida benthic mapping project. Even when a base shoreline was used for reference, it was updated to match the DOQQs.Some quarter quads were not available for 2004. The following quarter quads were used from previous years:From 1999:2822sw, 2722ne, 0909se, 0907se, 0907sw, 0906se, 0906sw, 0905sw, 0807ne, 0807se, 0713se, 0713sw, 0710sw, 0517se, 0614sw, 0516se, 0516sw, 0512neFrom 1994:1302ne, 0908se, 0807nw, 0807sw, 0712nw, 0709se, 0623se, 0623sw, 0615se, 0516ne, 0516nw, 0515nw, 0515sw</procdesc>

                <procdesc>The Indian River Lagoon portion of the shoreline was replaced with SJRWMD's 2008 Indian River Lagoon Shoreline. The SFWMD's 2004 LULC shoreline replaced the shoreline within the District's boundaries to improve accuracy. Also, the entire east coast was edited to remove several topological errors that can be described as small zig-zags within the shoreline.</procdesc>
